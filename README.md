# Crystal Collector Game
* Four crystals are generated, all assigned with a random value between 1 and 12.
* A random number between 20 and 120 is generated. This is the target number.
* When a crystal is clicked, the value is then added to the running total.
* It is up for the user to figure out the values of the crystals and get to the exact value of the target number.
* The user wins when the exact target value is reached, and has the option of playing again.
* The user loses if the value exceeds the target value, and has the option of playing again.
